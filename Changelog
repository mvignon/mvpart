he package MVPART is a modification of RPART --
 -- authors of original: Terry M Therneau and Beth Atkinson <atkinson@mayo.edu>, and
 R port of rpart Brian Ripley <ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk>.

Modifications of RPART to MVPART by Glenn De'ath <g.death@aims.gov.au>.

MVPART includes partitioning based on (1) multivariate numeric responses and
(2) dissimilarity matrices.

It was not possible to simply build a separate packge which required RPART due
to the modifications to the RPART C-code necessary to include the 2 new
partitioning methods.

As few changes as possible have been made to RPART.

In addition to the changes in the C-code, the following changes and additions in
R-functions have been made.

(1) A wrapper function for rpart called mvpart supports selection of trees by x-validation,
	interactive display, printing of results etc.

(2) Some multivariate methods to deal with representation and interpretation of multivariate
	partitioning objects have been added. These include PCA plots and tree-cluster comparisons.

(3) Methods for calculating increased forms of dissimilarities and for scaling matrices
	have been added. These are designed in particluar for community ecology.

(4) text.rpart has been modified to include graphical annotation of nodes.
